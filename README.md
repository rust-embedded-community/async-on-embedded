# `async-on-embedded`

> `async fn` / `.await` on embedded (Cortex-M edition): no-global-alloc, no-threads runtime

**Status:** Proof of Concept. Do not use in production.

***NOTE: [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) is a maintained, production executor and library with similar functionality.***

***NOTE: This library contains known bugs.***

Check `nrf52/examples` for an overview of what can be done with the runtime.

**NOTE** You need a rustc build that includes PR [rust-lang/rust#69033]
